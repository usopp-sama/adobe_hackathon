They can sign agreements using a web browser, mobile device, or Acrobat / Acrobat Reader desktop application. Send in bulk  allows you to upload a form and use that as a template to create and send many (hundreds!) of unique agreements, each dedicated to one external signer. Each agreement is insulated from the others and contains its own audit report. Each recipient is unaware of all other recipients. The sender has access to the agreements through their Home or Documents tab or through the  Send in bulk  template, which contains an Agreements report that tracks the overall status of the child agreements created from the template. Additionally, the sender can export the field-level data of all completed agreements in a CSV format using the Download Form Field Data action. To access the Send in bulk feature, do one of the following: \u2022 In the Acrobat desktop app, go to the  Tools  center ,  scroll down to the  E-Sign   section, and then select  Send in bulk . \u2022 Sign in to  Acrobat online , select the  E-Sign  menu in the top navigation bar, and then select  Send in bulk .",
