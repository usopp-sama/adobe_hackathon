# Adobe India Hackathon 2025

## Welcome to the "Connecting the Dots" Challenge

### Rethink Reading. Rediscover Knowledge

What if every time you opened a PDF, it didn't just sit there—it spoke to you, connected ideas, and narrated meaning across your entire library?

That's the future we're building — and we want you to help shape it.

In the Connecting the Dots Challenge, your mission is to reimagine the humble PDF as an intelligent, interactive experience—one that understands structure, surfaces insights, and responds to you like a trusted research companion.

### The Journey Ahead

**Round 1:**
Kick things off by building the brains — extract structured outlines from raw PDFs with blazing speed and pinpoint accuracy. Then, power it up with on-device intelligence that understands sections and links related ideas together.

**Round 2:**
It's showtime! Build a beautiful, intuitive reading webapp using Adobe's PDF Embed API. You will be using your Round 1 work to design a futuristic webapp.

### Why This Matters

In a world flooded with documents, what wins is not more content — it's context. You're not just building tools — you're building the future of how we read, learn, and connect. No matter your background — ML hacker, UI builder, or insight whisperer — this is your stage.

Are you in?

It's time to read between the lines. Connect the dots. And build a PDF experience that feels like magic. Let's go.
