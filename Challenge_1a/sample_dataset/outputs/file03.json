        "Background",
        "First, some background on the ODL. For the last two years the Ontario Library Association",
        "has acted as a catalyst, bringing together the stakeholders needed to create the Ontario",
        "Digital Library (ODL). These stakeholders include Ontario\u2019s 5000+ public libraries, university,",
        "college, and school libraries, as well as Ontario government ministries.",
        "Libraries that serve very different clientele recognize that by working together they can create",
        "seamless access to quality electronic library services. Through the ODL, students will be",
        "able to explore a topic at school, use the same child-safe resources after school (either at",
        "home or at a public library), enter college or university with a knowledge of how to use",
        "electronic resources that are still available and then, after graduation, continue to use these",
        "skills and resources at work or at home.",
        "We are moving into a period of convergence. With convergence we no longer have to license",
        "commercial products as individual libraries or institutions. We can work together to spend our",
        "money wisely. The provincial government has made this possible by working hard to provide",
        "all Ontarians with a stable, high-speed communications infrastructure. While there is still a",
        "great deal of work needed to improve this infrastructure, libraries are beginning to plan how",
        "best to exploit communications technology. We can reduce barriers to access and create the",
        "content infrastructure needed to support a knowledge society.",
        "The concept of an ODL is a key element in  The Roadmap to Prosperity , a strategic plan to",
        "envision and attain Ontario\u2019s economic goal prepared by the Ontario Jobs and Investment",
        "Board. The OJIB strategic plan recommends an electronic library to \u201cconnect students to new",
        "workplaces, new sources of information and applied learning opportunities\u201d. The ODL will do",
        "that and much more. The ODL will connect students to electronic information, and will also",
        "leverage this investment to help connect all citizens to the electronic information they need as",
        "they make decisions, solve problems and enhance their quality of life.",
        "Libraries have long been a key delivery point for public services. The ODL will allow that",
        "delivery point to move closer to citizens, into the smallest of libraries and even into living",
        "rooms.",
        "Libraries have a long tradition of using a practical, consultative approach to solving problems,",
        "and of learning from others. The ODL is a very practical solution to various problems.",
        "Jurisdiction-wide digital libraries are very practical and very real. The ODL we propose is",

        "3333",

        "public, post-secondary, special, government and regional libraries. Unlike ODL, TAL does",
        "not include elementary or secondary schools. However, the timeline and funding we are",
        "proposing for ODL is comparable to TAL\u2018s experience. TAL\u2019s business planning took several",
        "years. TAL\u2019s implementation plan was supported by 8 million dollars in provincially shared",
